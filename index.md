<!-- Data Science -->
A year out of business college, I was bored with my job and decided to learn to code. I dropped everything and headed to Chicago to learn to code.

Fast-forward four years later. Iâ€™ve been working professionally in the field of data science since then. My work has ranged from helping clients understand their website usage at a digital agency, building a monitoring tool for Tumblr bloggers, leading user acquisition at a venture-backed startup to finally work in data analysis and engineering.

This site chronicles my journey learning about **data science** and **building and marketing products**. All while teaching others to do the same.


*You want to get into the field of data science but don't know where to start?*

I've been there.
