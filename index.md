<!-- Data Science -->
In 2012, a year out of business college, I decided to drop everything and learn to code. In a period of three months, I **learned to code** and **shipped my first data product**.

Since then, I've been working heavily with data.

My work has ranged from helping big brands understand their web usage, building a monitoring tool for Tumblr bloggers and leading user acquisition at a startup that eventually got acquired by Intel. 

Right now, I am doing **data analysis and engineering** at Intel Security.

This site chronicles my journey learning about **data science**. All while teaching others to do the same.
