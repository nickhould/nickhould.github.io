<!-- Data Science -->
In 2012, a year out of business college, I decided to drop everything and learn to code. In a period of three months, I **learned to code** and **shipped my first data product**.

Since then, I've been working heavily with data. I worked as a digital analyst in a web agency, built a few data products and leading user acquisition at a startup that eventually got acquired by Intel. 

Right now, I am doing **data analysis and engineering** at Intel Security.

Here, I document my journey learning about **data science** all while teaching others.
