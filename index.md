# <strong>Hi, I'm JN</strong>

<!-- Data Science -->
In 2012, a year out of business college, I decided to drop everything and learn to code. In a period of three months, I **learned to code** and **shipped my first data product**.

Since then, I've been working heavily with data. I lead the user acquisition at a startup called PasswordBox. The product was used by over 15 million persons and was eventually acquired by Intel in 2014. Following the acquisition, I transitioned into data science.

Right now, I am **Co-Founder and Chief Data Officer** at [Breathe Life](https://www.breathelife.com/).

Here, I document my journey learning about **data science** and **growth** all while teaching others.
