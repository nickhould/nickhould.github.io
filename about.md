Hi there! I'm Jean-Nicholas Hould. I am an entrepreneur from beautiful Montreal, Canada. I enjoy running ultramarathons and making things.

I'm currently working on solving data science challenges at [True Key](https://www.truekey.com). I am passionate about data science, entrepreneurship and technology.

In the past, I've been an early employee at [PasswordBox](https://www.passwordbox.com), a password manager software company acquired by [Intel](https://www.intel.com) in 2014. At PasswordBox I worked on user acquisition, scaling the user base from a few thousands users to millions.

I'd like to learn more about how I can help you. [Email me here.](mailto:nick.hould+website@gmail.com)
